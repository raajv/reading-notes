# ORDER OF EXECUTION

- To find the source of an error, it helps to know how scripts are processed.
- The order in which statements are executed can be complex; some tasks
cannot complete until another statement or function has been run.

# DIFFERENT TYPES OF ERROR -


- Error:- Generic error - the other errors
   are all based upon this error

not declared/within scope

- If you know that you may get an error, you can handle
it gracefully using the try, catch, finally statements.
