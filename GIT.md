# GIT

*What is GIT?

GIT is a distributed version control system (DCVS). IN the sense it stores snapshots of changes made to your code.

A DCVS is better than a Version Control system as it adds redundancy into the sytem by removing a single
point of failure like a server crash.

To prevernt this sort of a catastrophy A DCVS then mirrors repositories so the single point of failure element is removed. This back up can be reloaded to the server.

Programmers can thus work in teams on their own offline stations then upload (push) their work on to the server.

# ADVANTAGES OF GIT

- GIT helps in tracking changes and prevents loss of data

- Local Operations can be performed on different stations.

- Helps you reference all changes made to your project by adding messages.

# LEARNING

## USING THE TERMINAL

We learnt to use the terminal to structure our folders.

Cloned the git in the terminal using the URL from github to get it locally - by using git clone "url"

Entered our repo using cd reading-notes which then changed it to main

Opened our prefered code editor which is VS code by using the command code . from main

Created this file using the command touch "filename" on the terminal

Now will be using ***ACP*** to push it up to github

# ACP stands for-

- `git add "filename"`

- `git commit -m "message here"`

- `git push origin main *since main is our root*`
