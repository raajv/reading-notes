# LISTS

- There are three t XX ypes of HTML lists: ordered,
- unordered, and definition.
- Ordered lists use numbers.
- Unordered lists use bullets.
- Definition lists are used to define terminology.
- Lists can be nested inside one another.

# BOXES

- CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box.
- You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.
- You can also control the borders, margin and padding
for each box with CSS.
- It is possible to hide elements using the display and
visibility properties.
- Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and
inline boxes made into block-level boxes.
- Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of
boxes containing text and the leading.
- CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image
borders and rounded borders.

# DECISIONS AND LOOPS

- Conditional statements allow your code to make
decisions about what to do next.
- Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>)
are used to compare two operands.
- Logical operators allow you to combine more than one
set of comparison operators.
- if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code
- if a condition is true, and another if it is false.
switch statements allow you to compare a value
against possible outcomes (and also provides a default
option if none match).
- Data types can be coerced from one type to another.
- All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.
There are three types of loop: for, while, and
do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.
