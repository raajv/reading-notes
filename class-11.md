# CHARTS

- Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool. 

- The first thing we need to do is download Chart.js. Copy the Chart.min.js out of the unzipped folder and into the directory youâ€™ll be working in.

With this we can either draw a line , pie or bar chart.

# CANVAS

- At first sight a <canvas> (Links to an external site.) looks like the <img> (Links to an external site.) element, with the only clear difference being that it doesn't have the src and alt attributes. Indeed, the <canvas> element has only two attributes, width (Links to an external site.) and height (Links to an external site.). These are both optional and can also be set using DOM (Links to an external site.) properties (Links to an external site.). When no width and height attributes are specified, the canvas will initially be 300 pixels wide and 150 pixels high
