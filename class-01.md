 a name and a value

## EXTRA MARKUP

- If you want to add comments in HTML we use `<!-- and -->`
-<meta> tag lets us supply info about the webpage.
-Escape characters are special characters used by webpages for eg `&lt;`

## LAYOUT
-The layout of a webpage is made by putting the HTML5 document in different areas in a structured way .
-The header will be in the <header> elements.
-while the main article could be in <article> or <section> element 
-These block level elements are used instead of <div> to understand the code better.

# ABC OF PROGRAMMING (JS)

A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow to achieve a goal. It is step by step instructions used 
by the computer.
Script can run different sections of code in response to the situation around them.It must help the computer solve the task programatically.


### Steps to write a Script-

# OBJECTS AND PROPERTIES

## OBJECTS- Each physical thing in the world can be represented as an object. eg-car
   
   Each object can have its own

- Properties
- Events
- Method

# How HTML CSS and JAVASCRIPT fit together

- HTML is the *content* layer
- CSS in the *presentation* layer
- javascript is the *behavior* layer

Eg of javascript - 

`document.write("Good Afternoon");`

where 
- the "document" object repesents the entire web page. All web browsers implement this object
- the write() method of the "document" object allows new content to be written onto the page where the <script> element sits.
- *parameters* are placed in the (). So in this case the *write* method needs to know what to write onto the page.
