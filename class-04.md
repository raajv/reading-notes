# FUNCTIONS METHODS AND OBJECTS
FUNCTION DECLARATION
- A function declaration creates a function that you
can ca ll later in your code.

FUNCTION EXPRESSION
- A function which is declared using a variable and then it is treated as an
expression, and it is known as a function expression.
In function expressions, the name is usually omitted.
A function with no name is called an anonymous
function.

SCOPE

The location where you declare a variable will affect where it can be used
within your code. If you declare it within a function, it can only be used
within that function. This is known as the variable's scope.

LOCAL VARIABLES
When a variable is created inside a function using the
var keyword, it can only be used in that function.
It is called a local variable or function-level variable.

GLOBAL VARIABLES
If you create a variable outside of a function, then it
can be used anywhere within the script. It is called a
global variable and has global scope.

# PAIRED PROGRAMMING

How does pair programming work?

- While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.
