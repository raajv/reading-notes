# PROBLEM DOMAIN

 

What is the hardest thing about writing code?

Learning a new technology
Naming things
Testing your code
Debugging
Fixing bugs
Making software maintainable
You can often make the problem domain easier by cutting out cases and narrowing your focus to a particular part of the problem.

-  *taken from the simple programmer*

# OBJECTS

Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model
of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object,
variables and functions take on new names.

 

- Literal notations are the easiest way to create objects

- you can access the property of objects using "." or "[]"

# DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL

 

- The browser represents the page using a DOM tree.
DOM trees have four types of nodes: document nodes,
element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes.
- You can select element nodes by their id or cl ass
attributes, by tag name, or using CSS selector syntax.
- Whenever a DOM query can return more than one
node, it will always return a Nodelist.
- From an element node, you can access and update its
content using properties such as textContent and
innerHTML or using DOM manipulation techniques.
- An element node can contain multiple text nodes and
child elements that are siblings of each other.
