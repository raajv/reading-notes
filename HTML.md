# HTML

## HTML IS *Hyper-Text Markup Language*

Before we understand HTML we should talk about *wire-framing*.

**Wire framing** is a practise which we use to help us visualise what our eventual website will look like.

It is usually drawn on paper , however software can be used aswell.

A good wireframe usually has structured content wihich will help you support the goal of your site.It will also show which area of your site is most prominent and first in view.

It will also show all the different tabs which will be available to the user in order to complete the desired action.

So now we are ready for some **HTML**

*HTML* helps us to add content to our website.

It also helps to enclose content to make it appear and act in a certain way.

This is done with the use of *tags*

*Tags* are wrapped in `<>`
for eg- the `<p>`which is the *paragraph* tag.

Tags are either
 - OPENING AND CLOSING or
 - SELF CLOSING

Text wrapped in a tag are called elements.
for eg `<p>text</p>`

There are also *attributes* that contain extra information about the element which does not appear in the actual content.

for eg `"class" or "href"`

## TYPICAL HTML LAYOUT-

 - `<!DOCTYPE html>`
`<html>`
 ` <head>`
    `<meta charset="utf-8">`
    `<title>My PAGE</title>`
  `</head>`
  `<body>`
    `<img src="IMg">`
  `</body>`
`</html> `

# SOME USEFUL TAGS ARE-

 - `<li> list`
 - `<a>  link`
 - `<p> paragraph`
 - `<h1> Heading`

 # SEMANTICS

 It is important to use semantics while writing HTML as a particular thing can be written in many different ways.

 It helps keep the code clean and helps collaborators find something that they would be looking for much more easily

 Search Engines also consider the contents of semantic markup to influence their rankings

 Screen readers help the visually impaired navigate a page.

# SOME EXAMPLES-

 - `<article>`
 - `<aside>`
 - `<nav>`
 
 etc
