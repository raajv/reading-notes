# GROWTH MINDSET 
 
Growth mindset for me is where you are willing to learn through effort and commitment.

## BE IN THE GROWTH MINDSET BY-
- Taking regular breaks ! (its important)
- Be inspired by the work of your classmates
- Review each day and see what i could have done better
- Time Management is an important skill and will work on it .
