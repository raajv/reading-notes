## IMAGES

 

- The <img> element is used to add images to a web page.

 

You must always specify a ‘src’ attribute to indicate the source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the content of an image.
 

-You should save images at the size you will be using them on the web page and in the appropriate format.

 

Photographs , gifs all use the same element img.
 

 

## COLOR

 

There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:  RGB values, hex codes, and color names.
There is a handy colour picker in vs code which helps to choose the colour that you want
Css3 has also introduced opacity , being the final parameter

Pseudo classes “:” can be used to change the color when the user hovers over the text . Eg “hover”
