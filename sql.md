| SQL | NoSQL |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| - SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases  |- NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database. |
| - SQL databases are table based |-NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores |
| - SQL databases have predefined schema |- NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data. |
| - SQL databases are vertically scalable| -NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.|
| - SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful.|-In NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language)  |
| - SQL database examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL. NoSQL | -MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb  |
| - SQL databases are not best fit for hierarchical data storage |-  NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data|
| - In most typical situations, SQL databases are vertically scalable. You can manage increasing load by increasing the CPU, RAM, SSD, etc, on a single server|-NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. You can just add few more servers easily in your NoSQL database infrastructure to handle the large traffic|




What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

structured data which follows the schema

Give a real world example.

MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL
What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

hierarchal data, follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data

Give a real world example.

healthcare data that uses key value pairs and uses mongo


Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

NoSQL
Which type of database is best for scalability?

NoSQL

What does SQL stand for?

structured query language

What is a realational database?

A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. Relational databases are based on the relational model, an intuitive, straightforward way of representing data in tables.

What type of structure does a relational database work with?

TABLE STRUCTURE 

What is a ‘schema’?

A database schema is the skeleton structure that represents the logical view of the entire database
What is a NoSQL database?

In NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language). The syntax of using UnQL varies from database to database.
Howo does it work?

 NoSQL databases do not rely on these structures and use more flexible data models.
What is inside of a Mongo database?

MongoDB makes use of collections and documents. Documents consist of key-value pairs which are the basic unit of data in MongoDB. Collections contain sets of documents and function which is the equivalent of relational database tables
Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

Mongo Db cuz it can take a better schema of data unline sql which can only take a particular strctured schema , it is also more scalabale by adding more servers to the mix 
What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

-Compatibility issues with SQL instructions
-Lack of standardizing
-They usually have not-really-useful management tools or console access
